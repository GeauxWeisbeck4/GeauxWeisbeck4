ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @GeauxWeisbeck4! I'm a freelance full-stack web developer in Raleigh, NC and am currently open to new clients and job opportunities.

## Latest Project: DailyProject.dev

I am working on a project called DailyProject.dev. I haven't shared it with the world yet, but I am working on it for the Refine.Dev Hackathon. I will share it upon the Hackathon's completion, but the basic idea is that there is a project each day that you can complete and compete against others by getting rated on a leaderboard of people who complete the projects eacy day. 


As for my other projects I work on in pulic you can check em out [here at my digital garden](https://andrewsdigital.garden).
