  This is where to start with my Github journey as far as my full stack developer career goes. I've been coding for years but
never got around to learning full stack, and I'm so happy I did. 

I am currently seeking freelance work or any type of employment as soon as possible really. I made sure that I got
good enough to know what I'm doing, at least all the way through a MEAN Stack. I am currently touching up on old
Python skills to be an even more dynamic full stack developer.

I would appreciate it if you followed me on Twitter @GeauxWeisbeck4
✨.

Cleaning up GitHub and planning on coming through and cleaning up all my repositories, organizing some as just watching and not having them as forks (decrease potential for cyber attack surface - and it looks nicer), and then getting ready to make sure I nail down the remote Git build for my JamStack App for the March Madness of Full Stack... Tech Stacks haha I typed that wrong but am in a hurry. 

Other News: Still looking for work or a way to make money! Subscribe to my newsletter - you can get most of the content for free still. I am just going to monetize some of these tutorials I create. Look out for my JamStack App here shortly - it's a quick build!
