  This is where to start with my Github journey as far as my full stack developer career goes. I've been coding for years but
never got around to learning full stack, and I'm so happy I did. 

I am currently seeking freelance work or any type of employment as soon as possible really. I made sure that I got
good enough to know what I'm doing, at least all the way through a MEAN Stack. I am currently touching up on old
Python skills to be an even more dynamic full stack developer.

I would appreciate it if you followed me on Twitter @GeauxWeisbeck4
