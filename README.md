- 👋 Hi, I’m @GeauxWeisbeck4 - I own a little web dev agency called [Tar Heel Dev Studio](https://tarheeldevstudio.com) in Raleigh, NC.
- 👀 I’m interested in Full Stack Development, entrepreneurship, and sports.
- My real name is Andrew and I'm a kind, compassionate, confident, and hard working individual who loves 
  creativity more than anything. I am part Native American and I take pride in that - I am a part of the Natives in Tech non-profit.
- 🌱 I’m currently a freelance full-stack developer who is lucky enough to say that I don't work with just one framework or
 language, but pretty much all of them.
- 💞️ I have a goal to build a robust community and develop web applications 
     that help make life easier for everyone, and create content that entertains and educates.
- 📫 How to reach me andrew.weisbeck@gmail.com or you can message me on GitHub!

  This is where to start with my Github journey as far as my full stack developer career goes. I've been coding for years but
never got around to learning full stack, and I'm so happy I did. 

I am currently seeking freelance work or any type of employment as soon as possible really. I made sure that I got
good enough to know what I'm doing, at least all the way through a MEAN Stack. I am currently touching up on old
Python skills to be an even more dynamic full stack developer.

I would appreciate it if you followed me on Twitter @GeauxWeisbeck4
✨.

I am still open and in need of employment. If you are curious about any of my work, want to talk about hiring me for a project 
or job, or want to code together for fun, hit me up at andrew.weisbeck@gmail.com - I'm always looking to get to know people!
