  This is where to start with my Github journey as far as my full stack developer career goes. I've been coding for years but
never got around to learning full stack, and I'm so happy I did. 

I am currently seeking freelance work or any type of employment as soon as possible really. I made sure that I got
good enough to know what I'm doing, at least all the way through a MEAN Stack. I am currently touching up on old
Python skills to be an even more dynamic full stack developer.

I would appreciate it if you followed me on Twitter @GeauxWeisbeck4

You can read my blog on my page or check out my newsletter.

I will post where you can donate to contribute to my work and how else you can help.

#UPDATE Friday April 1, 2022 Moving in a new direction with projects 

Today was the official start of the Section4 Product Positioning Sprint (my 2nd sprint through Section4) and I've decided
to deploy all of my attentive resources towards that and some other projects I have been thinking of. Unfortunately, the 
Full Stack March Madness 2022 got cancelled by lack of interest and ummm... covid haha...

I want to develop a recovery app that makes it easy to connect to other people with mental health issues and addiction 
issues with anonymity and trust. It will be completely free - hopefully people can keep me alive by donations if it 
becomes popular - and maintained by the users of the app. For example, you don't have to, but you can sign up to be 
called by somebody in need when you mark you are available and vica versa. But the apps services are always free with 
no required contributions. It will hopefully be a lifesaving resource for many people to have that one last option of 
reaching out to somebody who cares.

I also have some other side projects I am finally going to get going. The Mean Stack Developer is being replaced with the 
Free Stack Developer - my new newsletter, blog, tutorial, etc. website where I show devs how to do everything full stack 
for as cheap and effective as poosible. My psychology/mental health/mindfulness API/APP whatever its going to be - its going 
to be called MoonBuddhas - I know that - is in development too.

I am still open and in need of employment. If you are curious about any of my work, want to talk about hiring me for a project 
or job, or want to code together for fun, hit me up at andrew.weisbeck@gmail.com - I'm always looking to get to know people!
